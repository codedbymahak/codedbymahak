  <a href="https://www.linkedin.com/in/mahakgupta2405/" target="_blank">
    <strong>Mahak Gupta</strong>
  </a>,
  a 3rd-year Computer Science student based in India.<br>
  I try to learn at every step and honestly love jumping into new things — the more unexpected, the better.
</p>

<p>
  If an idea pops into my head, chances are high that I’ll try to build it.<br>
  My current favorite languages are <strong>Java and C++</strong> — the comfort combo that makes me feel like I actually know what I'm doing 😄
</p>

<p>
  My favorite project so far? 
  <a href="https://codedbymahak.github.io/EscapetheGargoyle/" target="_blank">
    <strong>Escape the Gargoyle</strong>
  </a>
  — because I'm a huge gaming freak and it’s the first project that made me feel,<br>
  <em>“oh wait… I can really build things.”</em>
</p>
